This directory is expected to contain the `rrq_producer` shared library for the
TypeScript producer FFI.

Supported filenames:
- `librrq_producer.dylib` (macOS)
- `librrq_producer.so` (Linux)
- `rrq_producer.dll` (Windows)

Alternatively, set `RRQ_PRODUCER_LIB_PATH` to the absolute path of the shared
library.
