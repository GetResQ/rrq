# Legacy Python Orchestrator

This directory contains the retired Python orchestrator implementation and its
associated tests/examples. It is kept for historical reference and parity
validation only.

Active runtime code lives in:
- Rust orchestrator: `reference/rust/rrq-orchestrator`
- Python producer/executor: `rrq/`
